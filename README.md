# SHAKE256-file-checksum-understandable-C-implementation
This is an understandable, dependency free C implementation of SHAKE 256 File checksum, inherited from SHA-3 cryptographic sponge function family, if you are calling it from linux console just compile it and follow as described:

-f filepath -o outputbits

The implementation's objective is to enlight begginers with a simple way to understand the NIST FIPS 202 standard, this implementation works with moderate efficiency, I understand it can be faster by using macros and other stuff, enjoy.
